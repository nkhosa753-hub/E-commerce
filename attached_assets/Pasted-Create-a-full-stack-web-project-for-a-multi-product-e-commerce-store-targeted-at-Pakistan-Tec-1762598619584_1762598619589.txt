Create a full-stack web project for a multi-product e-commerce store targeted at Pakistan.

🛠 Tech Stack:
- Backend: Go (Gin framework)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React (Vite + React Router)
- Auth: JWT (for admin)
- Hosting: Frontend deployable on Vercel or Netlify, backend deployable on Render/Railway.
- File storage: Local `uploads/` folder for images (later configurable for S3/MinIO).

🎯 Main Features:
1. Product catalog (title, description, price, category, multiple images).
2. Product details page with a “Buy on WhatsApp” button that opens WhatsApp Web or app with prefilled message:
   `"Hi, I want to buy <ProductName> from your store!"`
3. Admin panel to:
   - Add/Edit/Delete products
   - Upload multiple images per product
   - Create and manage categories/collections
4. Public site:
   - Home page with collections or featured products
   - Category listing pages
   - Product details page
   - Contact/WhatsApp floating button
5. API-based architecture so frontend and backend are decoupled.

💾 Database schema (tables):
- users(id, name, email, password_hash, role [admin|customer])
- products(id, title, slug, description, price_pkr, category_id, created_at)
- product_images(id, product_id, url)
- categories(id, name, slug)
- collections(id, name, description)
- product_collections(product_id, collection_id)

🧱 Backend:
- Endpoints:
  - Auth:
    - POST /api/v1/auth/login
  - Products:
    - GET /api/v1/products
    - GET /api/v1/products/:slug
    - POST /api/v1/admin/products (multipart/form-data)
    - PUT /api/v1/admin/products/:id
    - DELETE /api/v1/admin/products/:id
  - Uploads:
    - POST /api/v1/admin/upload → accepts `multipart/form-data` image and returns its URL
  - Categories & Collections CRUD for admin
- Use GORM or SQLx for DB access.
- Store images in `./uploads/` directory during development.
- Use JWT middleware for `/admin` routes.

🖥 Frontend (React):
- Pages:
  - `/` → Home (list featured products)
  - `/product/:slug` → Product detail page with images and WhatsApp button
  - `/category/:slug` → Products by category
  - `/admin/login` → Admin login page
  - `/admin/products` → Product list + Add/Edit forms
- Components:
  - ProductCard
  - ProductGrid
  - Header (with search + WhatsApp floating link)
  - Footer
  - AdminProductForm
- Use Axios for API calls.
- Implement `.env` file for backend API base URL.
- Include a WhatsApp floating action button on all pages linking to a given WhatsApp number (configurable in `.env`).

🧩 WhatsApp button logic:
When user clicks “Buy on WhatsApp,” open:
`https://wa.me/<YOUR_NUMBER>?text=Hi%20I%20want%20to%20buy%20<ProductName>%20from%20your%20store`
Example:
`https://wa.me/923001234567?text=Hi%20I%20want%20to%20buy%20Blue%20T-Shirt%20from%20your%20store`

Copy code
- Basic README with setup instructions for local dev:
- How to run backend (Go)
- How to run frontend (Vite)
- How to deploy backend (Render/Railway)
- How to deploy frontend (Vercel)

🚀 Deployment goal:
- Frontend → Vercel/Netlify
- Backend → Render/Railway
- Database → Railway free PostgreSQL instance

⚙️ Extra:
- Add CORS config in backend for frontend origin.
- Return clean JSON responses `{ "success": true, "data": ... }` or `{ "error": "message" }`.
- Use TailwindCSS in React for styling.
- Mobile responsive design.

Keep the code clean, commented, and minimal — no dummy data generators or unnecessary complexity.
